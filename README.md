# Robert Peary Middle School Educational Technology Plan

![Robert Peary Middle School !](https://schoolmint-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/explorelausd/upload/pi8rvp_IMG_0090.jpg "Robert Peary Middle School")

## Situation

Serving grade level 6-8, Robert Peary Middle School has not have computer science elective for many years. There have been other computer classes where students learn the basics of computers. They learn how to e-mail, use software from their chromebooks, and learn how to type on a keyboard. This school also use to have MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science, Achievemen). This program provided the opportunity to engineer projects in which they competed with other schools. Project such as prosthetic arm, glider, and presentation of the digestion system. These are only to name a few of the projects. In addtion, there was the opportunity for students to also code using arduinos to attach to the prosthetic arms. This program no longer exist in this school but one day it shall return.

The school had also a program with USC where students teamed up to discuss robotics. This school year we have changed our schedule. Students are given 4 classes for 10 weeks. This gives students more opportunities to take more elective classes. Students who have been in computer science for the first mester will return to third mester computer science elective. 





Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Course

**Course name** **COMPUTER SCI DISCOVERY A/B**

**Grade Level 7th**

**Description** 

Students are given the chance to work in Code.org and MIT Scratch. In [Code.org](https://code.org), students created a website and learned to code with angry bird characters. Through this free resource students learned basics on how to create tags for HTML. Students were also given the chance to learn how to code angry birds to send them to different locations to then complete tasks. With both of these prgrams students were given the chance to practice pair programming. 

  In [MIT Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), students were given different task to complete. These tasks were projects were like [Make a game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=chase-game), students are given a tutroial on how to make a game that will have them chase a charater to to score points. There are also projects brought to you by youtube. Such projects are like [the catch game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NN5v2wSL4U). Teaches students step by step on how to set up the code on catching falling objects. It teaches students how to use graphical planes to determine quadrants of x and y axis.
  
  Next time meeting with te students will be using program called [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com). This program has students work with objects that will give them 3D movement of the object but online. Students use this online program to then download their project to upload the saved file to [Ultimaker](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura). Students should have downloaded this software to their computer. This application is called Cura.This is the program that talks to the 3D printer machine. 
  
  Lastly, students will be using a [canvasworkspace](https://canvasworkspace.brother.com/en) to work with vynil/adhesive cutter. They will use this to design products to bring awareness to local or worldwide issues. This cutter uses an online program to have students type and design logos and text to print out in either an adhesive medium or vinyl to then adhere to other cloth like material. 

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
